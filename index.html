    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question"> How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? 
        Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"><span>Answer:</span>  I will advice the client to secure his website through the use of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
     . This makes sure the communication between the server and client is secured and achieved through the use of TLS or SSL.
    It also protects website from attacks. Another benefit of using this is the fact that google ranks the website on top in their search    </p>
